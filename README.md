# Various Userscripts

This is a collection of custom userscripts that I use to make browsing certain websites better. These are quick and dirty scripts that I don't intend to update regularly, only if the website that uses the script breaks it. The folder names are the websites these scripts are associated with.

## Installation
To use these scripts, you need a userscript manager such as Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, or SleazyFork. Working on getting a clickable link that will directly install the userscript into the monkey script managers, like found  [**here**](https://github.com/zerodytrash/Simple-YouTube-Age-Restriction-Bypass). Drap and drop the .js files into one of these programs, it'll ask you to install the script and then refresh any pages active after installing a given script.
